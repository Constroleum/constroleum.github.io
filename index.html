        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Pere Lluís León lives in Premià de Mar, a small seaside town near
          Barcelona. He began his drawing studies at a very young age, at a
          small private academy in Barcelona. Later, his undeniable vocation
          drove him to enroll at the Llotja School to study illustration.
          Subsequently, he studied drawing and painting at the Barcelona
          Massana Arts School. Never losing sight of a clear vocation for
          graphic arts, after a while he moved to Paris, Brussels, and
          Rotterdam where he alternated work with painting studies. Upon
          returning to Barcelona, he began working as a medical illustrator
          for laboratory advertising. He started collaborating with the
          Faculty of Medicine at Bellvitge, creating didactic anatomical
          illustrations for student research. It was then, when he specialized
          in medical and surgical illustration, also collaborating with the
          Clínic Hospital, Esperança Hospital, Vall d'Hebron, UAB, 12 de
          Octubre University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine in Barcelona,
          Lapeyronie Hospital in Montpellier, as well as for professors,
          professors, surgeons, and editors of medical books and specialized
          journals worldwide. Throughout his professional career, thousands of
          illustrations have been published in medical books and scientific
          journals. Currently, he alternates his medical work with graphic
          design and painting.
